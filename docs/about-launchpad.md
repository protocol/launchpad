# About Launchpad

PLN Launchpad is a six-week onboarding program to train, onboard, and match engineers at scale with opportunities across the PL Network. Launchpad cohorts will onboard a wide funnel of primed talent into PL Network teams - and also grow network engineering culture, strong community bonds, and solid cross-functional knowledge of various parts of the PL Network tools and protocols. You can read more about Launchpad [here](https://protocol.almanac.io/docs/launchpad-bo0e0qpGcnxNq85SIjUQNlQzn0AiEmCD).

## About the Launchpad Curriculum

This Gitbook Collection contains the Launchpad curriculum of learning materials. It is published from a repository which contains intentionally organized and curated content about the PL Network, IPFS, libp2p, IPLD, Filecoin, and the variety of tools & SDKs that are used across the network. We welcome contributions, but please read and follow the steps below in the **Contributing to Launchpad Curriculum** section.

This site is published on GitHub pages [On Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-L\_E2woSLfhpBp2IPz9k/s/dJC0yfHL6n4VMktmNXWq/), and the repo is located at [https://github.com/protocol/launchpad](https://github.com/protocol/launchpad)

## Contributing to the Launchpad Curriculum

Please work with the team to review and organize Launchpad Curriculum. In order to contribute, visit the public Launchpad repository: [https://github.com/protocol/launchpad](https://github.com/protocol/launchpad)

1. First, Check out the [README.md](../README.md) and [STYLE-GUIDE.md](../STYLE-GUIDE.md) in the root repo for how to format and organize your content
2. Find the section [in the `SUMMARY.md` file](../SUMMARY.md) where you want to add your content.
3. Create a new branch or fork, and find the .md doc (or create a new .md file) in the `/docs/name-of-section` [directory](https://github.com/protocol/launchpad/tree/gitbook/docs) where you would like to add your content.
4. Create a PR for your change. Questions? [ping the core contributors](https://github.com/protocol/launchpad/graphs/contributors) to this repository.

## Expectations

* How to use Github for source control, including making PRs & suggestions
* How to navigate and troubleshoot an operating system and install dependencies
* A good level of knowledge in the programming language(s) of their choice
* Experience using the basic software engineering design lifecycle
* Experience implementing and testing software projects

### ‚öñÔ∏è Launchpad Principles

* **Feedback is a gift.** Please give your feedback on the program and how we can make it better! If someone gives you feedback, it's because they‚Äôre trying to help you improve ‚Äî but understand there are often many ways to do something, so give feedback with curiosity and an open mind.
* **Improve as we go.** Related to the above, when you spot areas of improvement for the program, we want to capture them along the journey rather than hoping to remember them at the end. A retro will happen at the end, but please also post in #pl-bootcamp-v0 as you see things. Including an emoji like ü§î can make it easier to harvest these thoughts for the retro.
* **Be respectful**. This whole program falls under the IPFS Code of Conduct. Always be kind and welcoming.
* **Collaboration**. Be proactively helpful to everyone you can. Answer questions, offer ideas, share your work and learnings - try to give back to the community and others who are helping you! Understand that many great ideas can blossom in parallel - avoid being competitive, secretive, or ego-ful about your work or ideas.
* **Async first.** We bias toward async comms to support many time zones and schedules. Try to use slack threads, record meetings, and document your questions/learnings so others can benefit. More [here](https://app.gitbook.com/s/-M4ooPzkIHGnAcvo99dy/how-we-work/async-work).
* **Transparency.** To promote a good OSS environment, we try to make our work open to all - even before we‚Äôre ready. Please try to use group channels to post your questions instead of DMs (where others can‚Äôt learn from you), and share your answers in public forums wherever possible (ex discourse, Filecoin slack, etc).
