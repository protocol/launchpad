# libp2p Connections and Users

## Understanding Nodes

Although libp2p was originally developed to work with IPFS, you can use it to create p2p applications that have no relationship to IPFS at all. The modularity of libp2p allows you to take whichever pieces you need in your project.

A central term in a p2p network is the _node_. The concept of a _node_ is pretty broad in software engineering, but in libp2p, it usually refers to a single _peer_ of the network (essentially, a computer that might send or receive messages within the p2p network).

For example, in the following snippet, `go-libp2p` (the Go implementation of libp2p), is used to create a node with default settings.

```rust
use futures::prelude::*;
use libp2p::swarm::{Swarm, SwarmEvent};
use libp2p::{identity, ping, Multiaddr, PeerId};
use std::error::Error;

#[async_std::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let local_key = identity::Keypair::generate_ed25519();
    let local_peer_id = PeerId::from(local_key.public());
    println!("Local peer id: {:?}", local_peer_id);

    let transport = libp2p::development_transport(local_key).await?;
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="Go" %}
```go
import (
    libp2p "github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p"
)

func main() {
    host, err := libp2p.New()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
import { TCP } from '@libp2p/tcp'
import { WebSockets } from '@libp2p/websockets'
import { Mplex } from '@libp2p/mplex'
import { Noise } from '@chainsafe/libp2p-noise'
import defaultsDeep from '@nodeutils/defaults-deep'
import { createLibp2p as createNode } from 'libp2p'

export async function createLibp2p(_options) {
  const defaults = {
    transports: [
      new TCP(),
      new WebSockets()
    ],
    streamMuxers: [
      new Mplex()
    ],
    connectionEncryption: [
      new Noise()
    ]
  }

  return createNode(defaultsDeep(_options, defaults))
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Nodes establish connections with other nodes, so we need a way to locate those nodes. Multiaddresses specify the location of a node (e.g. which IP address and which port) and peer identifiers specify the identity of the node (e.g. once you get to the node, you can check if this is indeed the node you were looking for). 

### Peer Identity

Every node in the network is uniquely identified through its _peer id_. A peer id is generated from the public key of the node.
A peer id is a multihash, which essentially is a hash prefixed with the hash algorithm used (the same way that multihashes are used in CIDs).

- If the public key's length is more than 42 bytes, then the [multihash](https://github.com/multiformats/multihash) digest is generated by applying a hash function to the public key.
- If the public key's length is less than or equal to 42 bytes, then the multihash digest is the public key itself, and the hash function code is the _identity hash_. The identity hash means that the output digest is the same as the input.

### Multiaddress

We have every node uniquely identified by its public key, however, we still must know _where_ and _how_ to establish the connection.
A [multiaddress](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr) allows you to specify the transport for the connection (TCP, UDP, QUIC...) and how to reach the node to establish the connection (IP, DNS...).

The following example specifies a connection to the `127.0.0.1` IPv4 by using the TCP protocol at port 8080.

```
/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/8080
```

The main advantage of [multiaddresses](https://github.com/multiformats/multiaddr) is that they are self-describing. Only by looking at the address, you can figure out what protocols are involved in the connection.

### Establishing a connection

Now that we know how to reach our peers, we can create a connection. When we create a connection in libp2p, a process called _connection bootstrapping_ occurs. This process is responsible for:

1. Handshake: establish the _raw_ connection with the peer.
2. Security protocol: negotiate the security protocol for the raw connection (e.g. TLS).
3. Stream multiplexer: negotiate the stream multiplexer protocol.

Note that libp2p does **NOT** allow connections that are not secured or multiplexed.
When establishing the connection, we will have two actors: the initiator and the responder.

#### Handshake

The handshake starts the connection with the peer and verifies that the peer can understand the [multistream-select](https://github.com/multiformats/multistream-select) protocol.

After the handshake, the two peers must negotiate other protocols (security, multiplexer, application...), so we need a protocol that indicates how two peers can negotiate other protocols. The Multistream protocol allows peers to exchange what other protocols they support and negotiate them. Therefore, both peers must agree on the same version of Multistream.

```shell
# Request: Do you understand "/multistream/1.0.0"?
> /multistream/1.0.0

# Response: I do.
+ /multistream/1.0.0
```

#### Security

Now, the two peers will use Multistream to negotiate the security protocol, which allows the connection to be encrypted.

Usually, several protocols are tried during the negotiation, with a preference order. For example, you might try to use TLS first. If your peer does not support TLS, you might try Noise. When a security protocol is accepted, the connection is upgraded to use that protocol.

```shell
# Request: Do you understand "/tls/1.0.0"?
> /tls/1.0.0

# Response: I do not
+ na

# Request: Do you understand "/noise/1.0.0"?
> /noise/1.0.0

# Response: I do
+ /noise/1.0.0
```

#### Multiplexer

Once the connection is secured, a multiplexer protocol is negotiated. Muxtiplexing means opening up multiple distinct logical streams to a peer on a single connection. For example you may want to interact with a peer on the DHT, but you may also want to ping that peer. Multiplexing lets you do both of these on the same underlying connection.

Because the data will be sent over the same connection, we need an abstraction called _stream_. A stream represents the data for a specific protocol in a given connection. Data flowing through the connection is assigned its corresponding _stream id_. In the following example, the streams for two protocols are shown: [rendezvous](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/rendezvous/README.md#the-protocol) (with protocol id `/rendezvous/1.0.0`) and [identify](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/identify/README.md#overview) (with protocol id `/ipfs/id/1.0.0`).

![Streams in a single connection](<../../.gitbook/assets/libp2p-streams.png>)

### Negotiating protocols

After the connection is established (i.e. handshake, security, and multiplexing), peers exchange what application protocols they support. Because `multistream-select` is used, the procedure to agree on an application protocol is the same as for the security and mutiplexing negotiations: the protocol identifier is sent to the peer and `na` is answered if the protocol is not supported.

Every supported protocol is assigned a handler, which manages the data for that protocol.

### Peer Discovery

Every peer has an identifier, which is generated from its public key. However, this is not enough to find out the location of the peer. Libp2p exposes two interfaces: Advertiser and Discoverer.

The Advertiser offers services to the network, which means that it shares the protocols that it supports with the rest of the network. The Discoverer is able to find peers.

The are two main implementations: mDNS and the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table. The Kademlia DHT is used to discover peers in the IPFS network. Other implementations are also valid as long as they comply with the previously mentioned interfaces.
