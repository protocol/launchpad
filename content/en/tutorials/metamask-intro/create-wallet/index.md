In this tutorial, we will install Metamask and set up a wallet.

## Instructions

1. Open your browser and visit the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/).
1. Install the wallet by clicking the **Download for** button.
1. Once you have installed MetaMask, it will open a **Get started** window.

1. Follow the prompts until you MetaMask asks if you are **New to MetaMask**.
1. Because you still need an account on the Filecoin network, select **Create a wallet**.

1. Enter a secure password. You will use this password every time you want to open this wallet in this browser.
1. Click **Next** until you get to the **Secret Recovery Phrase** window. Read the information about what this _recovery phrase_ is on this page.
1. Once you've followed the instructions and saved your recovery phrase, click **Next**.
1. Confirm that you saved the recovery phrase correctly by clicking on the words in order.
1. Once you've done that, you should have your account set up!
