**libp2p is the networking & communication layer** for IPFS. [Visit the main website](https://libp2p.io/) for resources and information.

Moving from a location-addressed system to a peer-to-peer, content addressed system presents a lot of challenges. The internet as it is, with firewalls and NATs, was designed to provide data (securely) for the traditional Web2 systems.

libp2p is a modular system of *protocols*, *specifications* and *libraries* that enable the development of peer-to-peer network applications. Because of the way libp2p is architected, a lot of the needs and considerations that the web2 network was built on no longer apply.

**[See the Implementations and Bundles](https://libp2p.io/implementations/)** for all of the libraries of modules you can use and bundles for different use cases available in various languages.
