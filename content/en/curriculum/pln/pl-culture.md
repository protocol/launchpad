Protocol Labs is building the next generation of the internet. We are an open-source Network that spans the research-to-development pipeline to create new protocols, tools, and services to improve the internet radically. Our products serve thousands of organizations and millions of people.

Many teams in the PL Network are fully distributed and follow a common set of open-source practices to grow and flourish together. This distributed, open-source philosophy is at the core of how we operate.

We also believe in connecting and bringing people together to inspire innovation. That‚Äôs why we have yearly PL Network ‚ÄúLab Weeks‚Äù to gather our community of ‚Äúlabbers‚Äù (contributors and members of PL Network teams) together and align on the following year‚Äôs opportunities and challenges.

## Communication at Protocol Labs

_[See the complete information about how Protocol Labs communicates in Spaceport](https://protocol.almanac.io/docs/communication-t5gNj2sm6jShmc8ZGmGxvmB9Iw1WNCCU)_

In our mission to drive breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward, we welcome and listen to every voice. Humanity, after all, is composed of all humans, and learning from each other is vital.

To ensure these conversations remain constructive and safe for all, we have developed guidelines for participation:

* We are kind and respectful. We do not insult or disparage. And we ask questions, seek clarification, and assume we don‚Äôt know the whole story. We communicate in good faith, meaning that we don‚Äôt provoke people intentionally. We help one another grow and assume that we have the best intent.
* We are allies. We stand up for one another. We build the culture and environment we want to see. So, when we see something, we say something.

## How to Interact

Discord, Email, and Zoom are our workplace: in interacting with other Labbers, remember that they are your collaborators and peers.

* Written communication lacks important cues we typically get when speaking to others in person.
* Written communication is long-lasting: remember that written communication lasts longer than verbal communication so that others will return to it repeatedly.
* Mind the audience: in communicating with others, pause and think about who your message is intended for and whether the medium is appropriate.

## Ecosystem

The ecosystem team at Protocol Labs focuses on the broader community, including hackathons, grants, collabs & accelerators, browsers & special projects, growth & client solutions, the Filecoin community, and any other efforts to support and grow the ecosystem of technology built for web3.


## Principles

* **We should improve the internet and computing generally**. Secure and robust access to information, communication, and computing has become a critical part of what it means to be a modern human. The internet has become the primary vehicle for human interactions worldwide, and it will only become more so as our devices and interfaces improve. Brain-machine interfaces will cement this, and those are not so far away. Therefore, [fixing problems with the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RCwZDRwk48&t=568s) and upgrading our computational fabric will have a tremendous impact on humanity, now and in the future. **_This is the Why._**
* **We should accelerate the ideas-to-superpowers pipeline. **At the heart of computing progress lies a simple process: the research, development, and deployment cycle. Ideas are conceived and refined, encoded into mathematical rules, programmed into software, and deployed into computers, which grants humans worldwide superpowers. The better and faster we are at sifting ideas through this pipeline, the better and faster our superpowers will come. **_This is the How_.**


## IPFS, Filecoin, and the Distributed Web

Although we are young, we have already created a large ecosystem of interrelated projects and products. These have all spawned from the first IPFS and naturally have much to do with decentralized data distribution. Our approach is to modularize projects to serve as many people as possible carefully. Once it is clear a sub-project should be independent, we spin it into its own effort. I will leave the descriptions here short, click through to find out more about each.

## A Network Built around Market Protocols

A cryptocurrency can address a portion of the value created by the protocol, and it can be allocated to fund protocol creators and maintainers.

This is an unprecedented way to capture a fraction of the value created and feed it back into development. The IPFS protocol benefits its ecosystem and the creation of more protocols. Moreover, the value capture comes at the protocol layer and is not solely based on the applications or services above. The attention and interests of the protocol developers remain aligned with successful outcomes for the protocol and the projects building around it.

The cryptocurrency can incentivize individuals, and other groups outside the original organization, to improve and work on the protocol. It can also be used to fund the entire development of the currency, by pre-selling it as Ethereum did in 2014.


## Asynchronous Work 

At Protocol Labs, we follow principles around working asynchronously to enable contributions and collaborations worldwide.

Although this approach might seem non-traditional for some, the benefits of async communication are numerous:

üë©‚ÄçüíªThe ability to build large stretches of uninterrupted focus time.

üåèThe ability to communicate with a remote team, with members in multiple time zones.

üìëHaving a record of the communication shared that can be referred to later on. Whereas synchronous communication often requires taking notes (creating) while hearing the message (consuming).

ü§îThe chance to digest and think about a response before responding. (We all know immediate responses are often not your best.)

üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThe freedom to not have to be constantly ‚Äúat your desk‚Äù in case someone wants to talk to you.

This style benefits your teammates as well. Requesting someone‚Äôs time to find a document or pinging someone for something non-urgent are two of the most common productivity killers for deep-focus work. As you might be aware, there is a famous meme on how you should ‚Äúnever an interrupt a programmer.‚Äù Once you read it, you will quickly realize that this applies to all sorts of work.

There will be more async work in the [OS Stewardship](https://github.com/protocol/launchpad/blob/gitbook/docs/protocol-labs-network/os-stewardship.md) Section.
