Protocol Labs is a constantly evolving network of hundreds of projects, companies, and organizations. Understanding the landscape of organizations, projects, and teams can be complex. This section presents tools to help you understand and navigate these systems and organizations.

## Protocol Labs Portal

This portal is the central point of reference for all the resources available to PLN members. This portal includes information about Network Services from Mosaia, the network directory, and communication channels.

## Directories and Key Resources

* [Spaceport](https://coda.io/d/Protocol-Labs-Spaceport_dDpJBnYeqJb/What-is-Spaceport_suSQ9#_luhKz) is a network-wide directory and guide for those navigating the Protocol Labs web3 space with many links to resources for PL Network members, including:
* The [PLN Member Directory](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/teams) is a listing of all the companies, projects, and teams in the wider PLN
* The [PLN Code of Conduct](https://protocol.almanac.io/docs/pln-code-of-conduct-ymBUYyonmhfvizGu6yOpXH1qkuWYce96) outlines the expectations and code of conduct for all members of our network
* The [Glossary](https://protocol.almanac.io/docs/glossary-ycx3uRbXUM3d7uf1EBz89msUmb1UjzR7) provides a comprehensive list of terms to help you navigate web3
* The [Events Directory](https://events.plnetwork.io/) is a listing of all the company web3 events.


## Protocol Labs Ecosystem Directories

To explore the various projects and tools building in the IPFS & Filecoin ecosystems, use the explorable ecosystem directories:

* IPFS Ecosystem Explorer [https://ecosystem.ipfs.io/](https://ecosystem.ipfs.io/)
* Filecoin Ecosystem Explorer [https://ecosystem.filecoin.io/](https://ecosystem.filecoin.io/)

Use the ecosystem directory page filters to explore projects by what they do, the industry, and which tooling (such as IPFS, Filecoin, Kubo) to understand better what makes up the ecosystem.

## Teams & Groups of PL

The Protocol Labs Team has a handful of teams that support PL as a whole. Under PL are the following teams:

* Starfleet
* Ecosystem (Outercore)
* Network Goods
* Spaceport (Member Services)
* PL Corp

In addition to the primary teams for PL, we have a wide range of network partners that build on top of the protocols used within PL. As more teams are developed and expanded, a need for Working Groups was created to help with cross-department and company collaboration. Several core organizations make up the nucleus of the Protocol Labs organization.


### Starfleet 

Starfleet is composed of two major groups

* Engineering Research (EngRes)
    * IP Stewards, which houses
        * Libp2p
        * IPLD
        * IPJS
        * IP Productivity
    * NetOps which houses
        * Bifrost
        * FIL-Infra
        * Sentinel
        * Drand
        * Protocol Eng & Measurements
    * Bedrock
    * ResDev
        * CryptoNetLab
        * CryptoEconLab
        * ConsensusLab
        * Retrieval Markets
        * Computer Over Data
* Talent Funnel
    * Launchpad
    * People Ops
    * Recruiting

### Ecosystem ([Outercore](https://www.notion.so/protocollabs/Outercore-Engineering-0b1e72aed0684e668c0825a921831a74))

The goal of the Ecosystem is to develop tools, improve systems, conduct research, and share its OSS, processes, and ideas with the Protocol Labs Network. The Ecosystem’s goal is to help get more people into the ecosystem. It does not develop necessarily. They have a builders funnel that helps support and coordinate new folks looking at our tech stack(hackathons, incubators, even exploring partnerships with LinkedIn learning). The Ecosystem also gives storage provider community support and tooling support (i.e., Estuary), which will relate to core protocol development. They also collaborate with the Filecoin Foundation.

Under the Ecosystem is Outercore, which is comprised of the following groups:

* PL Fund
* Browsers & Platforms
* Engineering
* Marketing
* Filecoin Green
* SPs (Storage Providers) & Clients
* Web3 Collabs
* Network Growth
* Outecore Lab Incubator
* Builders Funnel

### Network Goods 

Network Goods is part of Protocol Labs, a company that works on early-stage research and development projects. Network Goods helps fund and support projects to advance science and technology for society. The team at Network Goods aims to create new tools and opportunities to achieve important goals in computing. They collaborate on research projects that can make a significant impact.

Under the Network Goods category, we have:

* Network Research
* Network Funding


### Spaceport (Member Services)

Protocol Labs is an open-source R&D lab that builds protocols, tools, and services to improve the internet radically. Within the Protocol Labs Network, there are many independent teams and organizations, each with unique objectives that further this mission.

Spaceport’s mission is to provide PLN teams and members with curated resources, connections, and services to help them build and scale web3 enterprises.

The goals of Spaceport are to:

* Understand and document PLN founder and team needs so we can develop services and offerings to meet them.
* Foster a collaborative community within the network to help teams and individuals connect and other valuable resources.
* Support founders and teams in their growth by providing resources, knowledge, tools, and connections.
* Drive adoption of PLN programs, tools, resources, and services.
* Track critical metrics, gather feedback, and iterate.

Teams under the Spaceport consist of:

* PL Community
    * Community Engagement
    * Marketing & Content
    * Events
    * Product
* Marketplace
    * Mosaia
        * Website design
        * Videography
    * CRCLE
        * Design
* Astrofitters
    * Swag
* Solaris
    * Event Planning
* Operations


### PL Corp 

In the PL Corp category, we have the following groups:

* Corp Legal
* DevCo People Ops
* Risk & Security
* Finance
    * Accounting
    * FP&A
    * Crypto Ops
    * Tax
    * Treasury

These groups collectively function to support Protocol Labs and its mission to drive web3 as the future of technology.

## Types of Groups

Each Working Group can experiment with setting its own pace, tracking work, and defining priorities. Working Groups should expose their focus through Objectives & Key Results (OKRs) to the rest of the organization (creating a “common interface” by which we can understand goals across the org), assign a Captain, create an entry point repo, and generally have at least two full-time contributors dedicated to the WG.

Contributors generally shouldn’t carry responsibilities across multiple working groups. This is not forbidden by any means, but it is usually discouraged as it could prevent the contributor from having the necessary focus.

Here is a [list of WGs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CiVUOicvY6V2NFZOEnJU0UHXPTAv2v3o_nh_nqSF01A/edit?usp=sharing) at Protocol Labs, and to form one, please ask the captains of the respected WGs.


Some Projects and Enablement Teams are experimenting with other ways of coordinating work, including Research Groups and Tiger Teams. IPFS, for example, has deployed both and has shared a [great explanation](https://github.com/ipfs/team-mgmt/blob/master/TEAMS_ROLES_STRUCTURES.md#expanded-description) of these coordination strategies and their benefits.

A Research Group is generally formed to explore a discrete research topic and is supported by the Protocol Labs Research Team. Members of Research Groups are encouraged to participate in multiple research groups. Tiger teams are small, temporary groups of people usually formed to solve a specific problem or build a complex feature. They frequently include when significant iteration/collaboration is required to achieve success. Once the objective is reached, the tiger team dissolves into their standard working groups.

Understand the basics of the Protocol Labs network & ecosystem, Web 3.0 blockchains, the semantic web, and the reasons that Protocol Labs is building the backbone for a distributed web. In this module, you’ll hear about issues facing Web 2.0 and motivation for Web 3.0, IPFS and its role in Web 3.0 with location addressing, and exciting projects in the IPFS ecosystem._

## The Future of Web3 

At the end of 2022, Protocol Labs consist of 450+ companies and projects building in our network. As the web3 space accelerates, now is a great time for high-growth researchers & developers inside and outside web3 to ramp up their “InterPlanetary” knowledge and contribute to these cutting-edge technologies.

From core OSS contributions to Radius grants distributed systems engineers to network researchers, community managers, and startup operators, there are many exciting opportunities across PLN teams and companies.
