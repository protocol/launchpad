## Content Identifiers (CIDs)

CIDs are:

* _the most fundamental ingredient of the IPFS architecture_
* used for **content addressing**
* a **hash** digest with some metadata
* **self describing**
* used to name every piece of data in IPFS

![](cids.png)

Example:

* **CIDv0**: [**`Qm`**`S4ustL54uo8FzR9455qaxZwuMiUhyvMcX9Ba8nUH4uVv`](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmS4ustL54uo8FzR9455qaxZwuMiUhyvMcX9Ba8nUH4uVv)
* **CIDv1**: [**`bafybei`**`bxm2nsadl3fnxv2sxcxmxaco2jl53wpeorjdzidjwf5aqdg7wa6u`](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafybeibxm2nsadl3fnxv2sxcxmxaco2jl53wpeorjdzidjwf5aqdg7wa6u)

_(These point to the same content but use two different versions of the CID specification, more on this later)._

CIDs are self-describing content addresses: hash digests with descriptions of what & how. They tell you the hash function used as well as the codec that can be used to interpret the binary data being linked to.

A hash digest is a fine content address, but a CID makes it self-describing and able to jump across systems.

A Git commit hash is just a hash digest and you know it's a SHA1 output because _it's Git_ and that's all Git has been using. But now that Git wants to start using SHA2-256 hashes, the assumptions built in about SHA1 are quite painful and they need a way to distinguish. If Git was built using CIDs instead, it wouldn't matter what hash function was used and upgrading would be trivial.

Similarly, you know that a Git commit hash addresses a Git commit because you use it within the Git context. But what if you wanted to address a Git commit from an Ethereum block and point to that Ethereum block from a reproducible build system? When using these digests you also need to say _what_ system those digests live within (i.e. where you might find them and what you might do when you locate the data).

CIDs give us a complete self-describing package:

* What hash function was used
* How many bytes of output we have
* What kind of data is being addressed and how we might interpret it when we find it

### CIDs are Immutable Links

Because of the wonders of content addressing, CIDs give us:

* **Self-certification / Integrity**: Content is authenticated by its address, not by a Certificate Authority -> Decentralisation
* **Deduplication**: Identical data can be verified by its address -> Caching -> saves resources and provides faster access to content
* **Immutability**: If the content changes, its address also changes -> Integrity Checking

Also: Change Tracking, Cacheability, Efficient Syncability, Scalability, Offline-first Architectures, Resilience, and more!

## Links –The Heart of IPLD

CIDs are the native link format for IPLD that distinguishes it from a simple data representation system. They are how we can connect graphs of data in flexible ways.

* Most data serialization formats, such as JSON and CBOR, don’t have a native way of representing links to content addressed data, so don’t have an in-built way to form graphs of linked data.
* IPLD brings its own formats that represent CIDs natively in the encoded bytes.
* IPLD can also be used as a lens through which to view other content addressed formats, such as Git, or Bitcoin from which we can derive CIDs by assumption.

## Anatomy of a CID

![](cid-anatomy.png)

CIDs build on some basic technologies for self-describing data:

* **Multihash**: A self-describing hash digest, using a pre-set number to identify the hash function used, comprises the main content of a CID.
* **Multicodec**: A pre-set number to uniquely identify a format, or protocol. Used in CIDs for the IPLD format that tells you how to decode the data when you locate it and load its bytes.
* **Multibase**: A self-describing base-encoded string, used for the string form of a CID.

Multihash, Multicodec, Multibase and CIDs are part of the "Multiformats" system for self-describing values.

A CID can be said to be built as a concatenation of these technologies: `<multibase>(<cid-version><multicodec><multihash>)`

### Multiformats

[Multiformats](https://multiformats.io/) were created to make formats, protocols, hash digests and other small values self-describing. They are useful in IPFS (and [any other system that implements IPLD](https://multiformats.io/#projects-using-multiformats)) for communicating encoding formats (codecs) and hash functions. Their self-describing nature is a form of future-proofing which prevents breaking changes and allows for interoperability between a wide variety hash functions and encoding formats, including those from other content-addressed systems.

#### Multiformat Protocols

* **Multibase**: Self-describing base encodings
* **Multihash**: Self-describing hashes
* **Multicodec**: Self-describing serialization
* **Multiaddr**: Self-describing network addresses
* **Multistream**: Self-describing stream network protocols
* **Multigram**: Self-describing packet network protocols

#### CID Multiformats

A **Multicodec** is a pre-set number to uniquely identify a data format or protocol. See the multicodec registry of the different formats: [https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec).

Generally, multicodec numbers are used as prefixes to the values they identify. When represented in binary, these are typically encoded as "varints", or variable-length integers ([LEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128)).

A **Multihash**, a type of multicodec, is a self-describing hash digest. The hash digest is prefixed with a number that identifies the hash function, and it makes it much easier for systems that depend on hash functions for security to upgrade if there is a cryptographic break.

The different hash functions can be seen in the [multicodec table](https://github.com/multiformats/multicodec). For example, the SHA3-384 hash function has the code `0x15`, while a BLAKE2b hash function with 384-bit output is `0xb230`. After the hash function code prefix, a Multihash also prefixes the length of the hash digest to follow. So a Multihash can be said to be: `<hash-function-code><digest-length><digest-bytes>`.

**Multibase** is a protocol that allows for string or text data to self-describes which base encoding is used. Multibase uses a prefix _character_ which describes the base used to encode the bytes that follow. For example:

* `b` - base32
* `z` - base58
* `f` - base16

The full list of bases and their mappings can be found in the Multibase registry at [github.com/multiformats/multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase).

While not the most compact string representation, _base32_ (b) is the preferred base encoding for CIDv1 because it only uses lower-case ASCII characters so is safe to use in DNS entries (and therefore URLs).

Fun fact: after [Kubo release 0.14](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/changelogs/v0.14.md#-emoji-support-in-multibase), emoji support [(base256emoji)](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase/blob/master/rfcs/Base256Emoji.md) was included for testing Unicode support, as visual aid while explaining Multiformats, or just for fun. The Multibase character for _base256emoji_ is 🚀, so every emoji CID will start with 🚀.  
```bash
# Encode "test" in base256emoji
$ echo -n "test" | ipfs multibase encode -b base256emoji -
🚀😈✋🌈😈

# Decode the emoji
$ echo -n "🚀😈✋🌈😈" | ipfs multibase decode -
test

# Transform the base32 CIDv1 to base256emoji CIDv1
$ ipfs cid format -v 1 -b base256emoji bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi
🚀🪐⭐💻😅❓💎🌈🌸🌚💰💍🌒😵🐶💁🤐🌎👼🙃🙅☺🌚😞🤤⭐🚀😃✈🌕😚🍻💜🐷⚽✌😊
```
This Multibase character says that all the following characters can be passed through a base256 decoder to retrieve the raw bytes.

### Interpreting a CID

A raw byte form of a CID is the concatenation of multiformat values `<cid-version><multicodec><multihash>`. When represented as a string (e.g. `bafyrei....`), the Multibase character is prefixed, so it becomes `<multibase>(<cid-version><multicodec><multihash>)`.

**CIDv0 is a special case** because it predates the Multiformats specifications. It's simply the Multihash of the content and as a string is represented using the Bitcoin variant of base58 (there is also a Flickr variant!). CIDv0 exclusively use the SHA2-256 hash function, and because the digest length is 256 bits (32 bytes), we end up with the Multibase prefix being represented as `Qm` in string form.

Beyond CIDv0, there is only one currently valid CID version `1`, but a CIDv1 in string form can use any base encoding in the Multibase table and represent the same CID:

* Base32: `bafybeibxm2nsadl3fnxv2sxcxmxaco2jl53wpeorjdzidjwf5aqdg7wa6u`
* Base58 (BTC): `zdj7WZAAFKPvYPPzyJLso2hhxo8a7ZACFQ4DvvfrNXTHidofr`
* Base64: `mAXASIDdmmyANeytvXUriuy4BO0lfd2eR0UjygabF6CAzfsD1`
* Base8: `7002700221003354646620015366255572724534256627001166445373566362164244362403233057202006337540365`
* Base2: `0000000010111000000010010001000000011011101100110100110110010000000001101011110110010101101101111...` (you get the idea...)
