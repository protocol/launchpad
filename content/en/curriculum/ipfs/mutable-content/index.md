* **IPFS 1.24 –** Understand the basics of the public DHT
* **IPFS 1.25 –** Understand garbage collection process on an IPFS node and how to keep data discoverable on IPFS

## Mutable Content
One of the most powerful things about IPFS is that any piece of data or content you store on the network cannot be modified without changing the [Content Identifier (CID)](https://protocol-labs.gitbook.io/launchpad-curriculum/launchpad-learning-resources/ipld/content-addressing-and-cids) for that data, since the CID is created (in part) by hashing the content. There are various ways to create mutable data on top of IPFS and in this lesson we will learn what just a few of them are.

### Pinning and Immutability

By default, content on IPFS is not _pinned_. That means when you add a file to IPFS, it will eventually stop being discoverable on the network. To mitigate this problem you must _pin_ your content to your [node](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/nodes/#nodes) to ensure it persists on IPFS.

Your options for pinning content are:
1. You pin it locally to your own node. Note that if the content is only pinned to your local node, it must be online for peers to get that content.
2. You use a [pinning service](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/persistence/#pinning-services). Some pinning services require payment for their services, others offer a [free storage allowance for new users](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/persistence/#ipfs-filecoin-solutions).

## The InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS)

Since IPFS uses CIDs, if you were to share an IPFS address such as `/ipfs/QmbezGequPwcsWo8UL4wDF6a8hYwM1hmbzYv2mnKkEWaUp` with someone, you would need to give the person a new link every time you update the content, because every change would result in a new CID.

The [InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS)](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipns/#interplanetary-name-system-ipns) solves this issue by creating a link that can be updated. IPNS addresses help bridge the unfamiliarity gap to a new internet for users who are used to location-based addresses like URLs for locating content.

This "link" in IPNS is called a _name_, this _name_ is the hash of a public key. The name is associated with a record containing information about the hash that it points to and is signed by the public key’s corresponding private key.
<!-- This allows new records to be signed and published at any time. Using IPNS means that when someone searches for your website using your _name_, they will receive the most up-to-date content as expected in today's internet. You can learn more about IPNS and [how to use it here](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipns/#example-ipns-setup-with-cli).

When looking up an IPNS _name_ via an IPFS gateway, use the `/ipns/` prefix: -->

### Pubsub + IPNS

[**Publish/Subsribe (PubSub)**](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/publish-subscribe/) is a messaging protocol to quickly communicate with other peers. Whenever a peer Publishes a message, Subscribing peers will receive it almost instantly. This protocol is not specific to IPFS or IPNS, but to [Libp2p](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/libp2p/); paired with IPNS, it allows for quick delivery of records over the network. With PubSub enabled on IPNS, updates to a record can be shared virtually instantly with subscribers.

To accomplish IPNS over PubSub, a [persistence layer had to be added](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/blob/main/naming/pubsub.md#layering-persistence-onto-libp2p-pubsub). Now when you ask for a name, you are subcribing to a PubSub topic based on that name, you create a connection with a peer that is following the same name, then they send you the latest version of the record. The key differentiating factor between IPNS-over-PubSub and IPNS-over-the-DHT (the default behavior) is opening a streaming connection between peers. This way, peers are sending the latest record directly from their local node, as opposed to the default behavior of searching the DHT for the peer with latest version of a record. This means records shared over Pubsub are not available on the DHT and vise versa, unless the publisher opts-in to publish records to both routing options. If you would like to activate IPNS over Pubsub on your Kubo node, you can check out the [`Ipns.UsePubsub` option](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#ipns) in the config file.
