### Objectives

**IPFS 1.0 Understand what IPFS is and why IPFS was started**
* **IPFS 1.01** Understand what is a peer to peer(p2p) network
* **IPFS 1.02** Know the difference between centralized, decentralized, and distributed networks
* **IPFS 1.03** Trade offs between centralized services & p2p systems
* **IPFS 1.04** Understand how IPFS is trying to design systems that are future-proof

IPFS is one of many [general purpose peer to peer (P2P) networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer#Other_P2P_applications). Peer to peer networks are groups of computers that share data amongst each other. In these systems, if we were looking for Beethoven's FÃ¼r Elise, we would ask a peer and that person will either respond with the song or hand along the request to another peer. Eventually, someone will return with the song if they have it saved. We could instead ask for the [IPFS white paper](https://github.com/ipfs/papers/blob/master/ipfs-cap2pfs/ipfs-p2p-file-system.pdf) and it would go through the same process. 

Peer to peer networks differ greatly from the world wide web. We can't go to a popular music streaming platform to ask for the IPFS white paper, where as in a p2p system we could.

## Why IPFS?

The acceleration of innovation over the past few decades, in comparison with the past million years of human evolution, is moving at an incredible pace.

IPFS as an organization is trying to look ahead to the next 10, 100, 1000 years and beyond and think about how computing will shape and impact a future we can't even begin to imagine.

Though it gets difficult to predict what is going to happen in the next, say, 100 years, we can start to invest in it now with Web3.

Computation has gone through so many phases; from the first computers, to machines that can timeshare, to multiprocessing and sandboxed VMs, to user terminals, to networked computers with multiprocessing, now with personal computers networked across a worldwide internet that all came from a relatively simple set of functions and data transmission. Now, IPFS is on the front lines of the Web3 evolution that will bring us to the next stage in computing.
