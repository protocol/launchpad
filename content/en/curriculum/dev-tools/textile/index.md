Textile is designed to connect and extend Libp2p, IPFS, and Filecoin.

Textile’s suite of developer tools, including Powergate, Buckets, and ThreadDB, let developers build meaningful experiences quickly with Web3 protocols like libp2p, IPFS, and Filecoin.

## Powergate

Powergate is an API for deploying hybrid Filecoin and IPFS storage into your stack. Designed for developers who want powerful ways to connect & extend Libp2p, IPFS, and Filecoin. It is a Docker container wrapped around an IPFS node + Filecoin node which allows you to stage, store, and retrieve data, with default configs for miner selection

## Other Tools

### The Hub
The Hub is your portal to the IPFS network and the fastest way to start building and experimenting with Textile technologies.

### Buckets
Buckets are:
* A new way to pin data to IPFS and archive data on Filecoin.
* Dynamic folders published simultaneously over IPFS, IPNS, and HTTP.
* Designed to simplify creating folders of data and pushing that data to remote IPFS peers for backup, persistence, or sharing.

### ThreadDB
ThreadDB makes dynamic data on the DWeb easy by providing simple data hosting services and an API familiar to anyone who used MongoDB/Mongoose.

ThreadDB is a secure, decentralized, p2p database built on IPFS and Libp2p.

Spend less time configuring encryption or managing content addresses with ThreadDB.
