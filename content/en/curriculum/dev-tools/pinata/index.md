Piñata is a pinning service that allows applications, creators, and individuals to interact with blockchain in a simple, intuitive way. With Piñata you can secure and pin NFTs, as well as add and hide files to the IPFS network with a feature called [submarining](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/introducing-submarining-what-it-is-why-you-need-it). They also provide [dedicated gateways](https://www.pinata.cloud/blog/the-power-of-dedicated-gateways) and storage servers, and easy upload through their UI.

For developers, Piñata offers an API endpoint (https://api.pinata.cloud/psa), which you can use with the [IPFS CLI](https://docs.pinata.cloud/api-pinning/pinning-services-api#configuring-pinata-in-the-ipfs-cli), or configure Piñata with IPFS Desktop and your [JSON Web Token](https://docs.pinata.cloud/api-pinning/pinning-services-api).
