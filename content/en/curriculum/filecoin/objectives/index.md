# Filecoin

Filecoin is at the foundation of Protocol Labs' mission to create a distributed, decentralized internet and a foundation for a better digital future. Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network coupled with a token that enables an economy of storage providers.

The mission of Filecoin and [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) is to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity’s information.

Filecoin is built using the core Protocol Labs technologies, including IPFS, libp2p, IPLD, and many more.

Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files, alongside a token that enables and incentives an economy that ensures files are stored reliably over time.

Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that provides data persistence via a decentralized protocol, and publicly verifiable storage proofs on a blockchain.
