# Filecoin

Filecoin is at the foundation of Protocol Labs' mission to create a distributed, decentralized internet and a foundation for a better digital future. Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network coupled with a token that enables an economy of storage providers.

The mission of Filecoin and [Filecoin Foundation](https://fil.org/) is to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanityâ€™s information.

Filecoin is built using the core Protocol Labs technologies, including IPFS, libp2p, IPLD, and many more.

Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files, alongside a token that enables and incentives an economy that ensures files are stored reliably over time.  It is also is a decentralized storage network that provides data persistence via a decentralized protocol, and publicly verifiable storage proofs on a blockchain.

In this section you will learn the mechanisms for how Filecoin works, as well as how filecoin is evolving from a decentralized storage network, into a network that also provides computational ability, a Content Delivery Network (CDN), smart contracts, and much more to create the foundations for a new kind of trustless, distributed internet.
