Drand is a distributed, bias-resistant, unpredictable, and publicly verifiable randomness generator that is key to the Filecoin implementation in how it provides unpredictable, decentralized and publicly verifiable random values for the blockchain. [Learn more about how Drand works in the docs](https://drand.love/docs/overview/#how-drand-works)

#### Drand: Distributed, Bias Resistant, Unpredictable and Publicly Verifiable Randomness | Nicolas Gailly
Drand uses [cryptographic methods](https://drand.love/docs/cryptography/#setup-phase), collective public keys, and a private key share of a collective private key to generate randomness in a distributed manner.

Drand is a distributed randomness beacon. It provides publicly-verifiable, unpredictable, and bias-resistant random numbers as a public service. In this module, we’ll walk through:

* Threshold Cryptography & Randomness
* Distributed Key Generation in drand
* The Setup and Randomness Generation Phases
* The League of Entropy
